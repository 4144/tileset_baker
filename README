TILED TILESET LAYER BAKER

bakes together layers of tiles created by Tiled Map Editor
http://www.mapeditor.org/

can bake layers from more level(tmx) files, the only condition is that all the level files uses the same original tileset


Example is included


PREREQUISITES

install python 2.7 from
http://www.python.org/getit/

install python pil library (pkg python-imaging) from
http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

for debian like OS:
`sudo apt-get install python python-imaging`


USAGE

Source files go to "src" folder
Source TMX files has to be in XML format only

Execute "merge.py" within a python interpreter with following arguments:
`./python merge.py first_colliding_tile [src_dir]`

param first_colliding_tile is an integer - a position of the first colliding tile in original tileset
optional param src_dir is a source directory relative from merge.py directory (default "./src")

Output files are created in "output" folder
folder is not emptied on execution, but is created if does not exist

tileset baker adds attribute collision_tile to every level file with integer value - a position of the first colliding tile in the new tileset

e.g. output/mapa1.tmx:
`<map height="30" orientation="orthogonal" tileheight="32" tilewidth="32" version="1.0" width="14">
 <tileset collision_tile="101" firstgid="1" name="tiles32" tileheight="32" tilewidth="32">`


NOTES

baker comes with linux and win executable bash files:
`merge.sh`
`winmerge.bat`

executable by doubleclick and including necessary argument of first colliding tile and path to python interpreter. fell free to modify them according to your configuration and original tileset
